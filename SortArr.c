//Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int n,x; scanf("%d",&n); int a[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) scanf("%d",&a[i]); scanf("%d",&x);
            int idx=-1; for(int i=0;i<n;i++){if(a[i]>=x){idx=i; break;}} 
    printf("%d\n",idx);
